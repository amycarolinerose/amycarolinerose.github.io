Thanks for visiting my website! Here I host links to my on-going work, papers I find interesting, and resources for others pursuing a PhD in economics.

I currently work as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors\* in a section called [Money Market Analysis](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/mamma-staff.htm). I attended Wellesley College, a historically women's college in Massachusetts, where I studied economics and mathematics. 

In my spare time, I'm an avid crafter - mainly sewing and embroidery, but also some crochet and knitting.

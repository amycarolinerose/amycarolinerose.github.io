Thanks for visiting my website! Here I host links to my on-going work, papers I find interesting, and resources for others interested in economics.

I currently work as a research associate at Harvard Business School with Victoria Ivashina, supporting her work related to private equity. 

Previously I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in a section called [Money Market Analysis](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/mamma-staff.htm). I attended Wellesley College, a historically women's college in Massachusetts, where I studied economics and mathematics. 

In my spare time, I'm an avid crafter - mainly sewing and embroidery, but also some crochet and knitting.
